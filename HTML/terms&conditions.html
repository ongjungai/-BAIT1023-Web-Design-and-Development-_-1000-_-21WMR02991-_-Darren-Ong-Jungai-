            <b>2.4.1 General Aspects of Contract Formation</b>
            
            <br>The following applies to all types of products. All information on the Website is an invitation to treat only. 
            <br>In other words, the information is not an offer or binding contract. You agree that your order is an offer to purchase the Products listed in your order.
            <br>
            <br>All orders submitted by you are subject to acceptance by us. We are entitled to verify an order in advance at all times and/or to refuse to accept an order without providing reasons and with no liability to you or any third parties. If we do not confirm acceptance of your order within ten working days, it is deemed to have been refused.
            <br>
            <br>We may choose not to accept your order at our own discretion. 
            <br>Examples of when we may not accept your order are as follows:
            <br>
            <br>If Product(s) are shown on the Website but are not or no longer available;
            <br>If we are unable to obtain authorisation of your payment;
            <br>If shipping restrictions apply to a Product;
            <br>If Product(s) shown on the Website contain a (manifest) error such as being incorrectly priced or otherwise incorrectly described.
            <br>In the event that we do not accept (part of) your order we shall be entitled to cancel (part of) your order without incurring any liability towards you or a third party. Following the cancellation we will of course provide you with a refund for the amount paid to us under the cancelled (part of the) order.
            <br>
            <br>We reserve the right to cancel your order after the creation of the contract of sale, thereby terminating the contract of sale, for the reasons stipulated in this section 
            
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>2.4.1. under headings a through d above.</b> 
            <br>Following the cancellation we will of course provide you with a refund for the amount paid to us under the cancelled (part of the) order.

            <br>
            <br>
            <b>2.4.2 Special Aspects of Contract Formation for Products</b>
            
            <br>After your order has been placed, we will send you an order acknowledgement email with your order number and details of the  Products you have offered to purchase and details of any delivery services. Acceptance of your order and the formation of a contract of sale of the Products between you and us will not take place unless and until either:
            <br>
            <br>you receive a confirmation from us that the Products have been shipped to you from our warehouse; or
            <br>you receive a confirmation from the carrier that the Products are ready for you to pick up if you have chosen to pick up the Product(s) at a carrier office or the carrier has stored the Products at the pickup location; or
            <br>you receive a confirmation from us that the Products are ready for you to pick them up at the selected SportoSense store, in the event you have chosen to collect the Products you ordered and paid for on the Website at an SportoSense store (Click & Collect).
            <br>
            <br>Please note that the Click & Collect functionality available on the Website in your country, may not include the option for you to order and pay for the Product on the Website (as described under clause 2.4.2 c), but give you the option to reserve a Product on the Website and to then buy and thus pay for it locally in an SportoSense store. 
            <br>
            <br>This Click & Collect reservation is only possible in selected SportoSense stores as indicated during the checkout process on the Website. If you buy the reserved product, you are concluding a purchase agreement with the SportoSense retailer of your choice locally. This means that you can only return the Product(s) to the same store you bought it from, subject to the return policy of that store. 
            <br>Therefore sections 2.13, 2.14 and 2.15 below do not apply because they apply only to the return of Products purchased through the Website.
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>2.5 RETENTION OF TITLE</b>
            <br>All Products will remain the property of SportoSense until you have paid all amounts owed to us in full under any agreement, including the payment of costs, earlier or later deliveries or partial deliveries. You may not sell, dispose of or encumber any Product before full title thereof has passed to you.
            
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>2.6 MAINTENANCE OF PRODUCTS</b>
            <br>We draw your attention to the washing and maintenance instructions printed on the labels of the Products. We are not liable for any damage resulting from incorrect handling of Products, including handling contrary to the instructions
            
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>2.7 ORDER CANCELLATION</b>
